  <footer class="highlightb">Setting ourselves apart because we offer a new, complete humidor package. You won't find a humidor with a smart component that is automatic, consistent and leak proof. Our usage of acrylics instead of wood inside the case will hold the most flavor and humidity for the longest periods of time. </footer>

    <h6> Good UI! </h6>
    <ul>
    <li><span>Doordash</span>
      <br><p>Is remarkably easy to scroll through and complete an order. It uses Millers Law to its advantage by only presenting a maximum 6 restaurant options at the same time both on the mobile app or PC website. It makes use of the law of Proximity for all search and filtering related tasks along with dividing content into category based chunks.
      </p></li>
      <p class="picalign">
    <img src="doordash.png" alt="centered image" style="width:400px;height:400px;"/>
</p>

    <li><span>Airbnb</span>
      <br><p class='left'>Is relatively simple to use. It makes use of Miller’s law and the Law of Proximity (quite literally) by organising rental listings into smaller location based categories. It also adheres to Doherty’s threshold by advertising or prompting the user with something- almost instantly.
      </p></li>
     <p class="picalignleft">
    <img src="airbnb.png" alt="centered image" style="width:400px;height:400px;" />
</p>  
   <li class='picalign'><span>Instagram Reels</span>
      <br><p class='right'>Came out as a reaction to Tiktok. Makes use of Jacob’s law for usability. The like, comment and share buttons along with the reel creation interface is all in the same place as they are for Tiktok on the screen and are the most important tools for engagement with the reel. It also makes use of the Law of Proximity since the buttons are grouped together column-wise in a certain area of the screen. It also instantly loads a couple of reels so that content is served instantly- respecting Doherty’s threshold.

    <h6> Envinsioned IA </h6>
      <p>A typical user might want have a preference in their type of cigar or cannabis for optimal, personalised settings of temperature and humidity.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Our product will utilize the Principles of Choice, Exemplars and Front Doors. Apart from the set up, the user only needs to interact with 2 dials and can see his past settings too. Utilizing a simple architecture here enables the least resistance in daily operation. </p>
      <br>
       <p>The Topical Organization makes the most sense for the Chamelodor. It falls in line with the simple, easy to use interface. </p>
