  <footer class="highlightb">Setting ourselves apart because we offer a new, complete humidor package. You won't find a humidor with a smart component that is automatic, consistent and leak proof. Our usage of acrylics instead of wood inside the case will hold the most flavor and humidity for the longest periods of time. </footer>

    <h6> Good UI! </h6>
    <ul>
    <li><span>Doordash</span>
      <br><p>Is remarkably easy to scroll through and complete an order. It uses Millers Law to its advantage by only presenting a maximum 6 restaurant options at the same time both on the mobile app or PC website. It makes use of the law of Proximity for all search and filtering related tasks along with dividing content into category based chunks.
      </p></li>
      <p class="picalign">
    <img src="doordash.png" alt="centered image" style="width:600px;height:400px;"/>
</p>

    <li><span>Airbnb</span>
      <br><p class='left'>Is relatively simple to use. It makes use of Millers law and the Law of Proximity (quite literally) by organising rental listings into smaller location based categories. It also adheres to Doherty’s threshold by advertising or prompting the user with something- almost instantly.
      </p></li>
     <p class="picalignleft">
    <img src="airbnb.png" alt="centered image" style="width:500px;height:400px;" />
</p>  
   <li class='picalign'><span>Instagram Reels</span>
      <br><p class='right'>Came out as a reaction to Tiktok. Makes use of Jacob’s law for usability. The like, comment and share buttons along with the reel creation interface is all in the same place as they are for Tiktok on the screen and are the most important tools for engagement with the reel. It also makes use of the Law of Proximity since the buttons are grouped together column-wise in a certain area of the screen. It also instantly loads a couple of reels so that content is served instantly- respecting Doherty’s threshold.

    <h6> Envinsioned IA </h6>
      <p>A typical user might want have a preference in their type of cigar or cannabis for optimal, personalised settings of temperature and humidity.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Our product will utilize the Principles of Choice, Exemplars and Front Doors. Apart from the set up, the user only needs to interact with 2 dials and can see his past settings too. Utilizing a simple architecture here enables the least resistance in daily operation. </p>
      <br>
       <p>The Topical Organization makes the most sense for the Chamelodor. It falls in line with the simple, easy to use interface. </p>
       <br>

    <div class='team'> 
      <h6> Features vs Benefits </h6>
   
      <ul>
    <li><span>Accurate temperature and humidity control</span>
      <br><p> Since our product will use actual bead humidifiers, the control on the humidity will be very accurate. A feature for the cigar and cannabis enthusiasts, it makes sure the products are stored optimally The benefit here is that the user will receive peace of mind and product maintenance reduction because of the feature.
      </p></li>
         <li><span>Leakproof Acrylic Storage Technology</span>
      <br><p> This feature is aimed at devoted hobbyists. Tobacco enjoyers struggle with maintaining their humidors because they either have to replace the humidification packs or have a significant amount of humidity leak through their wooden cases. It benefits the user because it reduces the maintenance of the product and makes it easier to use.
      </p></li>
       <li><span>User Settings History</span>
      <br><p> This feature lets users know their past settings and gives the user the benefit of deciding which of their past configurations worked best for their own liking. This feature is aimed at both budding enthusiasts and experienced hobbyists.
      </p></li>
        <li><span>Satisfying Interface</span>
      <br><p>A rustic physical UI with a wooden panel and satisfying metal switches and a virtual UI that provides simplicity benefits the user by making the storage experience more enjoyable. It also helps make the product a better display piece too.
      </p></li>
        <li><span>RGB Lighting </span>
      <br><p>Helps the product be a better display item while also beneffiting the user by giving them more control over its appearance. Most people using this product might use this feature depending on how the product is displayed- most people might want to make sure it matches the aesthetic of its surroundings.

      </p></li>
    </div>
       <div class='KVP'> 
    <h6> Interactions </h6>
      <p>Our interaction design will definitely be focused around themes including reactivity, visual design and interface controls. Our goal is to provide both a physical and virtual interface that is satisfying to use. The physical iterface is entered around a rustic theme with a wooden panel and toggle switches that are satisfying to use. The confirmation received after using this action along with the ease of the action itself is a part of our interaction design. With respect to our app, it will be simple to use and will have the main settings displayed on the front page instantaneously since these humidity and temperature settings are what the user will use most. Another area of interaction includes the user settings history which will be an easy to read graph of past environment settings.</p>
      </div>
         
      <div class='KVP'> 
    <h6> Costs </h6>
      <p>Broadly, we have 2 different types of material costs: Raw material including wood, metal and acrylic followed by circuit component materials. Our raw material can be expected to cost 30$ at scale. The brunt of our cost rests on the raspberry pi and the other circuit components and the humidifier which is roughly 50$ or 80$ in total.
</p>
        <br>
        <p>Assuming the circuit components are pre built at a flat rate, our manufacturing will revolve around assembly and can be estimated 15$ an hour. Per product, we arrive at a labor cost of roughly 25$: assuming one person assembles a single product at the same time. </p>
        <br>
        <p class='highlight'>Thus, our total costs sum up to 120$. </p>
       <br>
        <p>Our costs can further be broadly split into two categories: Fixed and Variable. </p>
        <br>
        <p class ='highlight'>Fixed Costs </p>
         <ul class ='highlight2'>
  <li class ='highlight2'>Circuit components 
</li>
  <li class ='highlight2'>Raw Material (Wood, acrylic, metal)</li>
  <li class ='highlight2'> Maintainance</li>
      <li class ='highlight2'> Warehouse Rent</li>     
</ul>
        
        <br>
        <p class='highlight'>Variable Costs </p>
         <ul class ='picalign'>
  <li>Manufacturing costs 
</li>
  <li>Labor</li>
  <li> Processing fees</li>
      <li> Transport Costs</li>     
</ul> 
        
      </div>
        <div class='KVP'> 
    <h6> Revenue </h6>
      <p>We plan to employ a retail and online sales model along with a subscription model for remote features and accessibility.
</p>    
          <br>
          <p>
            Selling the hardware product at a one-time fee of roughly 350$, we plan to induce a subscription at roughly 10$ for continued access to remote features and past data.
          </p>
          
<br>
          <p>
          Our online portfolio might include our own website, amazon and online cigar stores (eg jrcigars). Our retail porfolio will include certain grocery stores, liquor stores and smoke shops. The wholesale distribution model might also be used to sell directly to businesses like the aforementioned smoke shops. </p>
          <br>
          <p>
          Our expected revenue split is 60-40 with respect to online vs retail sales. At a conservative first year estimate of a thousand customers, our revenue will be 470,000$ with roughly 70% of this revenue coming from the one time fee and the rest from the subscription cost at 6$ a month. This implies projected online revenues of 282,000$.
 </p>
          
      </div>
      <div class='KVP'> 
    <h6> Pivots </h6>
      <p>A situational pivot we’ve made is to not include a temperature control element. Our previous MVP included a heating element/coil capable of warming the contents of the product very subtly but our new MVP will not contain this feature. 
</p>    
          <br>
          <p>
            A pivot we are entertaining for the future includes a platform/ customer base change: The product could be altered to be a weather containment device that would have a few more applications apart from tobacco or cannabis storage. The new product could be used for food storage and medicine.
          </p>
          
<br>
          <p>
          Our online portfolio might include our own website, amazon and online cigar stores (eg jrcigars). Our retail porfolio will include certain grocery stores, liquor stores and smoke shops. The wholesale distribution model might also be used to sell directly to businesses like the aforementioned smoke shops. </p>
          <br>
          <p>
          Of the 10 pivot strategies,  the removal of the heating feature is both a zoom-in and technology pivot since this is a feature that will be introduced in the future but not within the MVP. With regard to marketing the product as a weather containment device instead of a humidor, this would include a business architecture pivot
(since the product won’t be a luxury item anymore), and a platform pivot. 
 </p>
        <br> 
        <p>The selling point and brand of the product will change in this regard to have more applications. The aforementioned picot could be considered a zoom-out pivot too- a testament to the wider application space of the Chamelodor.
